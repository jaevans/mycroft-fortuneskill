# FortuneSkill

This is just a simple [Mycroft](https://mycroft.ai) skill that reads the output of the `fortune` program. My first attempt to learn the `skill-sdk`.

`fortune-mod` must be installed for the skill to work. There's not currently any error checking, or interaction beyond starting the skill.
